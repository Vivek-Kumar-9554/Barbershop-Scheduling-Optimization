Introduction
In a barbershop, scheduling appointments can be a complex task. This project tackles the challenge of scheduling appointments for multiple barbers while considering factors such as customer types, operation costs, time requirements, and potential discounts for customers.

Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine and make sure you have the required dependencies installed. The primary libraries used in this project are NumPy, random, and Matplotlib. These libraries are essential for data manipulation, random number generation, and result visualization.

Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to optimize the scheduling of appointments in a barbershop to maximize profits. This involves assigning customers to different barbers, considering the type of service they require, and balancing various factors like operation costs, customer types, and potential discounts.

Genetic Algorithm
The core approach of this project is the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find the best scheduling arrangement. The GA evolves a population of potential solutions (schedules) over multiple generations. Parents are selected from the population based on their fitness (profit), and offspring are generated through crossover and mutation operations. The offspring are then evaluated and added to the population if they meet certain criteria.

Model Variations
The project explores two variations of the optimization model:

Model 1: The initial model considers customer types, operation costs, time requirements, and membership discounts. It employs a Genetic Algorithm to evolve schedules over multiple generations, aiming to maximize the barbershop's profits.

Model 2: The enhanced model includes an additional parameter - membership fees. It investigates how different membership fee levels impact the barbershop's profits. The Genetic Algorithm is applied to find the optimal membership fee that maximizes profits.

Results and Analysis
The project provides valuable insights into how different customer types, operation costs, time requirements, discounts, and membership fees impact the overall profits of the barbershop. The included graphs visualize the optimization process, showing the evolution of profits over generations and the impact of varying membership fees.

Conclusion
Optimizing barbershop scheduling is a complex task that involves balancing various factors to maximize profits. This project demonstrates the use of Genetic Algorithms to find efficient scheduling solutions. By exploring different model variations and analyzing results, the project sheds light on how various parameters influence the barbershop's profits.
